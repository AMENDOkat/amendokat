And in a state of deep decay
Your flesh it rots away
But I still can't accept that you have died
I know that I should bury you
Can't bear to let you go
'Cause I haven't got the strength to say "Goodbye"

As I lay beside you, your body oh so still
Believe me love, I could never do you ill
I just want to hold you, put your hands upon my flesh
Your fingers so cold, the uncertain feel of death

Only you and I know what goes on behind closed doors
And now I can do things to you I never could before
Be still my love, as in your arms I lie
A much more faithful lover than you were before you died

And in a state of deep decay
Your flesh it rots away
But I still can't believe that you have died
I know that I should bury you
Can't bear to let you go
'Cause I haven't got the strength to say "Goodbye"

Lying in our bed, so peaceful yet so cold
You will never know the joys and pain of growing old
I handle you so gently, I must not increase the loss
I live in mortal fear, that the best bits might fall off

And in a state of deep decay
Your flesh it rots away
But I still can't accept that you have died
I know that I should bury you
Can't bear to let you go
'Cause I haven't got the strength to say "Goodbye"
When people call to see you, I say you've gone away
Only you and I know that with me you'll always stay
If I bring home other lovers there is nothing you will say
I know I can rely on you to stay out of the way

We never seem to argue like we use to do before
And you don't come home at 4AM lay drunk outside the door
And I will never find a more faithful geezer
I know when I'm out clubbing you're at home locked in the freezer
