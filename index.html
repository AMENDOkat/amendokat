        <p>The files for my website are hosted and deployed via Github. To achieve this, I had to do some trickery with the directory structure. This is the <i>actual</i> first page of the site, the one I assume you're looking for is in a subdirectory just under here.</p>
        <p>If you got here on purpose by messing with the url, congratulations! This is in fact what you were looking for! Not much to see unfortunately.</p>
