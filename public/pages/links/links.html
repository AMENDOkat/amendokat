                                        <p>Best browser on the web if you disagree <em>GET OUT!!!</em> By the way, don't use any Firefox forks, more often than not they're behind on updates - anything you can do on them, you can do on the normal browser - so just get the normal one. Don't use Chrome, it <em>SUCKSX</em>. Don't use Edge, you can do better than your default browser. Don't use Opera, yes Opera GX is included, SPECIALLY Opera GX, they're gonna get all your data and feed it to the <i>Evil AI Robot</i> from the movie <i>Don't Create The Evil AI Robot</i>. Don't use Brave, it's full of crypto shit and bloatware, and again, anything Brave does, FF can do (even better) - it's also chromium based. Tor is fine, but no reason to use it unless you're doing something illegal - it's just too slow man! Don't use Internet Explorer or Netscape - where did you even get those in 2025? Conclusion: Firefox is highly customizable, adblock actually works on it and it's the only browser on the web fighting against total-chrome-domination and to keep your data safe! So go pet the fox (it don't bite) and help make the internet a better place. I use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a>.</p>

                                        <p>"yt-dlp is a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader with support for thousands of sites", basically the most powerful video/audio downloader you can get, and it's 100% free - actually, every other downloader out there is most likely a wrapper of yt-dlp. The only drawback, is that it doesn't have GUI, it's a command line program, so it looks a bit intimidating and may take a while to learn, but I promise you, if you want to download videos or music, yt-dlp is worth every second of your time. However, if you don't wanna bother with learning it, <a href="https://cobalt.tools/">Cobalt Tools</a> is a simple and easy to use alternative - even your grandma could do it! The drawback is of course that it's <em>a lot</em> more limited in what it can do.</p>

                                        <p>Free, open source media library. It's like having your own Netflix and you can organize it however the hell you want. It's AWESOME!!! It also has a pretty large library of plugins, a personal favorite of mine is <a href="https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin">Youtube Metadata</a>. It grabs the JSON file you downloaded with your video (yt-dlp <i>hint hint</i>) and makes Jellyfin process the info from that file so it thinks the video is just a standard movie or episode from a show you downloaded, which means it can actually organize and read them properly. For someone who's never used any program like this, it may seem stupid, but believe me, once you try doing <i>anything</i> web related in a media library like Jellyfin or Plex (JF but worse), you'll understand why this is a <em>lifesaver</em>.</p>

                                        <p>The three websites you're gonna see the most when searching up anything HTML, CSS and JS related. MDN Web Docs and W3Schools both feature documentation on all the different tags and functions ur gonna encounter on your coding journey. Mozilla's documentation is a lot more complete, but also harder to understand, for beginners W3Schools is better. Different from the last two, Stack Overflow is a forum for asking questions, chances are whatever weird quirk you have going on with your code, someone else's already encountered it before and asked that question there.</p>

                                            Great channel for learning if you're just getting started with HTML, CSS and JS. Do keep in mind though, I would only recommend his tutorials if you never had any contact whatsoever with the languages and have limited programming knowledge. Once you start to learn more, you realize he glazes over a lot of important concepts in order to keep the videos simple and understandable. Again, great for beginners, not so great if you already know some stuff. I started learning through his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw">HTML & CSS Course</a>.
