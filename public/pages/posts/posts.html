                                        Reviewing the website right now before I publish it to Github, just making sure I don't overshare too much on the internet. And reading back on these posts, I have a few thoughts:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>1.</b> I do overshare A LOT. If the post dates look weird that's because I had to weed out A LOT of stuff.

                                    <p>
                                        <b>2.</b> I have some big opinions sometimes. Mouthful to talk shit about Harry Potter fans, alcoholics and people who hate vegans... (is there even a name for that?).

                                        Existing in this world is SO. tiring. Every time I open the news it's always "Trans people now have less rights than they did 30 years ago." "The government just decided that 'billion dollar corporation' can burn every tree that exists to make 000000000.02 cents in profit." "The police brutally shot an innocent person yesterday for no reason at all!!!" "Israel killed 10 million little kids yesterday and they're gonna do it tomorrow too and there's <em>nothing</em> you can do about it and the people that can <em>aren't going to</em>."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I'm so TIRED. I'M TIRED OF EVERYTHING BEING HORRIBLE ALL THE TIME AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. GOD!!!!!!!!!!!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And I can't bring myself to ignore the world burning around me because it just feels so <i>alienating</i> and. it limits you. you <em>need</em> to know what's happening because you <em>need</em> to fight back, but it's so. exhausting. it just feels like such a fruitless fight sometimes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don't even think I'm angry anymore, I'm just so tired. I wish things were different.

                                        The site's pretty much done. All that's left to do is debugging some stuff and cleaning up the code, and I didn't realize this would be the <em><b>worst</b></em> part. Spent hours today going back and forth through the homepage trying to figure out why the layout wasn't working. The reason? the div "content_block", which is a fundamental part of every page here,  was actually written "content-block". Yeah. That little dumb thing took an embarrassingly long time to figure out.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Besides coding, I've also been getting into Duke Nukem and Postal these past few days. Specifically Duke Nukem 3D and Postal 2. P2 is genuinely one of the funniest games I ever played, i love the postal dude mwahmua muah - he's my <s>loving</s> hateful husband. Also wanna try making DOOM wads, it looks fun and relatively easy compared to modding other games.

                                        2:45 and the bell went off <br>
                                        Thank God, many people think I'm odd <br>
                                        But I talk with no one and I walk alone <br>
                                        And I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I get home and don't say hi, it ain't no one there <br>
                                        I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs <br>
                                        To my room, get in bed and just wait for dark <br>
                                        Because that's when the real show start (Tap, tap) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        "Tap tap" on the glass go the piece of ass <br>
                                        So young and pretty, it's too bad she passed <br>
                                        But she comes to my room and we talk at night <br>
                                        She's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone <br>
                                        And I kiss her cold lips until the morning come <br>
                                        Then she gone, I can still hear her voice loom <br>

                                        Love (I can't ignore you) <br>
                                        In my room (Do anything for you, baby) (Tap, tap) <br>

                                        In my room, you and I (Tap, tap go the piece of ass) <br>

                                        I try to smile a lot, but I'm always frontin' <br>
                                        But I do love a ghost and at least that's somethin' <br>
                                        She don't talk much, when she do it gets cold <br>
                                        Usually we just lay there and we hold each other <br>
                                        <br>

                                        And it scared my baby, guess she don't like pets <br>

                                        God I fucking hate wearing braces so much, this shit is <em>SO</em> hard to clean. They hurt and I can't eat anything because they break for nothing. Such a sensory nightmare too, having my mouth full of metal all the time. Just a FUCKING NIGHTMARE. dentists for real ran out of shit to make up and then invented what is essentially the closest the average modern man can feel to medieval torture.

                                    <p>
                                        I <em>HATE</em> Harry Potter fans. <em>PLEASE</em> read literally any other book and stop giving your money to "real life voldemort". You're a full grown adult, you know better than this.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Stop defending the series on the internet, there's no "separating the art from the artist" here, or in any other place really, but that's a discussion for another time. The bankers in harry potter are evil money hungry/money loving goblins with long noses. There's a black character called Kingsley Shacklebolt. There's an asian character called Cho Chang. Her nazi beliefs bleed through every word and page on those books.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       Important to mention too, engaging with Harry Potter media <em>in general</em> is bad. I don't care if it's fan made or you pirated it or whatever. You're still helping keep that thing relevant by engaging with it. It <em>doesn't matter</em> if it's your fitgirl Hogwarts Legacy copy or your little gay marauders AO3 fanfiction. You're indirectly giving Margaret Tatcher's love child money by helping keep her series relevant. Money that she's <em>actively</em> using to fund anti trans groups to take away YOUR rights.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "but I like hp :&#40;&#40;&#40; what am i supposed to do? just stop liking it?" Yeah. That's exactly what you need to do. Just stop liking tiktoks about it and reading your little fanfics and <i>I promise</i> in a few weeks you'll grow out of it. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don't wanna say anything too out there, but if you engage with and genuinely enjoy any sort of HP related media, I really think you should review your morals and how they impact the media you consume.

                                    <p>
                                        I like watching videos of vegan recipes because they always look sooo good, and in the comments there's always a lot of dumb motherfuckers who hate vegans for no reason just talking shit. I really don't understand why someone caring about animals makes people so mad. There's also a lot of people that I see saying shit like "if vegans hate meat, why do they keep trying to replicate it?" like mofo everyone fucking knows they do it for the animals, istg these people act dumb on purpose cause there's no way.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        All this to say, I can't wait to move out of my parent's house so I can become vegan. Life advice for my readers: talk to someone about vegans and see how they react, it's a great way to weed out weird freaks that are <em>way too worried</em> about other people's life decisions - peak ragebait for conservatives, they fall for it every time. For vegans: you guys are fucking awesome. For carnivores and people who hate vegans: I'm gonna eat your dog.

                                        I feel like there's nothing fun left to watch on Youtube. Like, I can scroll on it for hours and I'm gonna see a lot of videos that <em>feel</em> like they could be fun, but I know if I watch them it's just gonna be the same lame shit from always.

Call me lame, but I do think it's dumb if you can't go out anywhere without drinking. I don't know. Drunk people are stupid and annoying, I wouldn't wanna be around them willingly. I just think there are better ways to get crazy. Snort a line and chew some gum or some shit, that's gotta taste better than your piss drink.

                                        Took a break from coding this website for a while. I have one of those health issues artists do in their hands, never looked into it so idk which one - my guess is carpal tunnel - and my symptoms have been really flared up recently. One thing that's been helping me feel better is keyboard navigation - even using the mouse makes it worse - and I had no idea it was so intuitive?? Incorporating this in my usual browsing activities foh sure!!!

                                        I understand neocities is all about self expression, and I love that, it's great, it's fucking awesome. However, some of you need to read like, one singular article about acessible design. Your webpage shouldn't have 7 different textures with shitty contrast stacked on top of each other and it shouldn't take SUPER FUCKING LONG TO LOAD!!!! That's annoying and it's a nightmare for the plebians with shitty internet (me), anyone with a visual empairment disability or really anyone who <b>actually wants to read</b> what you're writing. Please, there are so many resources online. If you don't care for accesibility, at the very least make the text on the screen readable.

                                        This website is really the only thing I have going for me rn. Haven't drawn in months, outta college, outta job. Godamn. At least it's fun. I like coding. Coding is fun. I can't imagine the pain in the ass it must be to do it professionally though. I worked as a graphic designer for a couple of months for this digital marketing company and it was quite literally the worst job experience I've ever had. I've had bad commissioners before, interned in a lab where my job was washing they dirty chemical dishes, but nothing compares to how bitchy GD clients are.
