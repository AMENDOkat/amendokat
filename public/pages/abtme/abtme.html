                                    My name is Kat, I'm the webmaster for this site and in this big ass text you're gonna find out everything you need to know (and don't need to) about me! 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Actually, Kat isn't my real name, it's just what I go by online. My name is Arthur.I've been on this earth for 19 years (can't say much about other the earths), my social security number is 16052018 in DD/MM/YYYY format. I'm single, HMU poniez &lt;3 im also a 20 centimeter tall little pony which means im very fragile and you need to handle me gently and be nice to me or im gonna shrivel up and die. Yeah, that's right. Think about that before posting a hate comment on my page. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Jokes aside, I'm an artist. I mostly work with digital art, I barely ever draw traditionally, did some experimenting with oil paints before but nothing major. I love painting, it's my absolute favorite part of the drawing process, and I feel like, when you look at my art, the colors and brush work reflect the love I've put into them. At least, that's how I see it, and I hope other people do too =&#41;. Most of my drawings are fanart, I draw the stuff that I like and that I'm interested in, and for the past few years, the one thing I've been majorly fixated on is My Little Pony. So, expect <em>loads</em> of ponies. <i>One pony in particular actually...</i>
                                </p>

                                    Cozy Glow! She's been my special interest for a while now, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. See how I specifically used the words "special interest" to refer to her? That's because I'm autistic! I feel the need to mention that because it's just such a big part of my life, I feel like I'd be a <em>completely</em> different person without it. It's something that affects every facet of my living and specially my relationships, be it romantic, platonic, or even the relationship I have with my interests.

                                    Besides from Cozy Glow, I've also had a number of hyperfixations in the past (and currently). The Owl House, Avatar the Last Airbender (specifically Azula), The Phantom of the Opera, Archiving/Data Hoarding, Lost Media and the Columbine case.

My headcanon is that Cozy spent 10 years in stone then got freed and Flurry helped reform her. No it's not weird, don't be annoying. I've had more than enough conversations about this.

                                    Another thing you should know about me is that I'm trans. Specifically a trans man. Unfortunately haven't started my transition yet, yk how it is with conservative parents. Similar to what I've mentioned earlier, I feel like being trans is such a fundamental part of who I am as a person that even if I had been born a cis man, I would <i>somehow</i> still be trans. I just can't see myself not being this way. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Important to mention that I'm queer as well. Not sure what flavor yet, but I am. I like anyone that interests me, <i>if that means anything.</i>
                                </p>

                                    As you can imagine by my page and my previous paragraphs here, I'm a leftist. <em>EXTREME</em> left. I'm a punk, there isn't a drop of conservative blood in my body and if there is I'm <b><em>BLEEDING IT OUT!!!</em></b> I'm a communist, politics are extremely important to me - I <em>LIKE</em> talking politics - and I think someone's political views are the easiest way to determine whether they're a good person or not. Good rule of thumb is that anyone on the right is rotten of heart and not worthy of your time. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I think that's pretty much it for the most important stuff about me, so here goes a bunch of bullshit.
                                </p>

                                    I began learning how to sew so I could sew on patches on my jacket and pants. Haven't practiced in a while, but I made some nice progress.
                                </p>

                                    I would love to make a game one day, but for now the only real coding experience I have is making this site.

                                    I wouldn't consider myself a <i>gamer</i>, but I play some stuff. I really like Red Dead Redemption 2 (Arthur's such a cutie pie); Undertale & Deltarune (core parts of my life growing up); Stardew Valley's fun; I have a little over 100 hours in Skyrim; and I like modding Minecraft and DOOM (vanilla's fun too, but iykyk).

                                    <em>I LOVE MUSIC!!!</em> I listen to basically everything, but there's a lot of metal and a lot of musicals. Goths RULE, punks r fine ig. Here goes a few recommendations for you that had to be revised 10x over because the first few drafts of this text were a huge wall of text. All links here are Youtube links because FUCK SPOTIFY!!! (youtube deserves to get fucked too, but i hate spotify more).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My favorite musicals are Wicked, Heathers and Phantom of the Opera. If I had to pick a song from each, it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe9N3Xcwtso">No One Mourns The Wicked</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWGksAK2NmQ">The Mirror/The Phantom of the Opera</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbiGahwoFJk">Meant to be Yours</a>. Underrated but worth checking out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbRfQAHfdg">The Ballad of Jane Doe</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlv3ipgvc7Y">Just Around The Corner</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I really like hardcore punk and death rock, my favorite bands from each are Mukeka di Rato and Scary Bitches. Favorite songs from them: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAaaez21rpo">Necrofancy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EktdeppZDc">Rinha de Magnata</a>. On the folk punk side, AJJ's album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HutFfYK2L20&list=OLAK5uy_m94ep76c_fLMKVsMVFxoWGgM6HzObFYe8&index=4">People Who Eat People Are The Luckiest People In The World</a> is <em>definitely</em> worth a listen.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My favorite metal bands are KMFDM, Powerwolf and Sabaton. KMFDM SUCKS!! AND POWER METAL FUCKS!!!! Metal's greatest hits -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ3lsxONdiw">Kunst</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxWiRU1wrPo">Blessed & Possessed</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1snEYPg8TXs">The Red Baron</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I also listen to a lot of other stuff as I've mentioned before. Lots of soundtracks and songs from tv shows, games and movies. Country stuff, mostly cordel. I like a few military songs, usually Soviet Union stuff, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Seqq72LioI">To Serve Russia</a> is really good. ICP, don't consider myself a juggalo tho, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgh4lRFchQM">In My Room</a> is my favorite song from them. Aurelio Voltaire has a lot of great stuff, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb7W_cikUp0">Raised by Bats</a> is a song that means a lot to me. Mother monster - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBynw9Isr28">Abracadabra</a> will always be my favorite. There's a lot of other bands and artists that I only listen to two or maybe three songs and therefore haven't made it to this list - a few that come to mind: Rammstein, Rita Lee, Marina and the Diamonds and Will Wood. 
                                </p>

                            <h4>Is kat your real name?</h4>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                                My real name is Arthur, but online I go by Kat. No I don't have a preference, just don't call me "Amendo". I know that this is the very first thing I mentioned on this page, but people online who only know me by Kat tend to be shocked when they find out it isn't my actual name.

                                            <h4>What does "Amendokat" even mean?</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                "Amendokat" is the fusion of two words: amendoim - peanuts in portuguese; katze - cat in german. So a "translation"
                                                could be "nutscat". No, the nutscat thing wasn't intentional. I was very young and wanted a unique internet username, 
                                                so I went to Google Translate and tested out some stuff. It doesn't sound great, but I think I'm too attached now to change it xP

                                            <h4>How did you learn to draw?</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                I don't know if I can give much of a helpful answer to this question, because truth be told, as far as I can remember I've always liked drawing and I've always been drawing.
                                            </p>

                                                One thing that I like doing is picking an artist who's art style I really enjoy and dissecting it. Try to figure out the steps they took to achieve that look in their work and try to replicate it.  Incorporate what you learned in your own art style. Two artists with awesome art styles you can look at are <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/jewellier">Jewellier</a> and J. C. Leyendecker (<a href="https://www.artnet.com/artists/joseph-christian-leyendecker/3">this site</a> has a great collection of his work)!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I also like doing value and anatomy exercises, I find that values is something beginner artists tend to ignore a lot, and it's a simple concept that can take your art from a 60% to 100%. I mostly enjoy painting, and I feel like it's the thing that really stands out in my work, so It's what I focus on. The very basis of painting is value and color, so if that's something you wanna learn, focus on those two first - textures, brushstroke coordination etc. aren't gonna mean much if your colors are muddy and all the greys in your drawing blend together.

                                                One book I can recommend and that I reference very often for my work is <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Art_of_Animal_Drawing_Construction_Action_Analysis_Caricature_Dover_Art_Inst">The Art of Animal Drawing, Construction, Action Analysis, Caricature (Dover Art Instruction) by Ken Hultgren</a> - It gives a great breakdown of the anatomy of various types of animals and common ways to stylize them.

                                            <h4>What did you think about the 1943 movie "Phantom of the Opera" by Universal?</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Honestly not a fan. For a movie called "Phantom of the Opera" the Phantom takes a ridiculously long time to show up. We only see him like, 50 minutes in? Why would a movie be named after a guy that only says maybe 7 full sentences?
